# the good and bad of teaching CS
## Introduction
It’s been a difficult school year, so my recollection of anything more than a week earlier is somewhat hazy, at best. Nonetheless, I can recall two incidents, both from this school year, that represent the highs and lows of teaching computer science.

## A low
This year I’m teaching computer AP CS A for the first time. As we discussed in class last semester, a major difficulty with this course is that it focuses exclusively on Java.  This means that a great deal of the first months of the class require hacking through the thickets of Java syntax.  Great swathes of syntactical ground must be cleared before any higher order CS concepts become evident.  This takes several weeks at least.

Anyway, the first incident I recall was introducing the idea of classes and objects  to students.  This being several months now, most of the details have washed away, but I distinctly recall the students not really having a clear distinction of the difference between a class and an object.  I think part of the issue is that when I introduced this topic, during the third week of class, students were still getting used to Java syntax.  Another related issue is balancing the specifics of the Java class construct with the general idea of a class.

In the future, it might be helpful to introduce classes with Python, a language that students taking the course will already be familiar with.  This will make it easier for the students to grasp the concepts. And when we translate into Java it might be easier for students to distinguish the Java specifics from the bigger picture.

## The good
The more positive example likewise comes from this year’s AP CS A.  It involves introducing arrays. When I introduced this idea I explicitly compared to something they were familiar with: Python lists.  This helped them conceptually make sense of the idea by comparing it to something they already understood.  A danger here is that they will then get hung up the idea that Java arrays are just like Python lists, leading to some confusion. But this tension can be utilized by challenging students to make a superArray class, just like we did this summer, to manage the deficiencies of a Java array. This naturally leads to the ArrayList.
