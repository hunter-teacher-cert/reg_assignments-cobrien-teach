# Assignment representing data with Arrays

- Use imdb.com to look up the budget and international gross of your five favorite movies.  

- Write a **Movie** class:
  - include *title*, *budget*, and *gross* as instance variable.  
  - Include a static arrayList variable variable called *film_list*.
  -  Write a constructor method. When a new object is initialized, the new object should be added to the static arrayList variable.  This can be done with **film_list.add(this)**.  

- Write static methods for this class  that return: The highest grossing, lowest grossing, and most profitable movie of the ones you picked.

See Movies.java for a representative submission.
