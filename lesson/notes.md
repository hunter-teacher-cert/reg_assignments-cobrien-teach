Below, I describe how my lesson plan changed with peer feedback. In general, the initial idea for the lesson was quite sketchy (basically, talk about selection sort), and I found discussion in our groups helpful in terms of fleshing it out. For instance,  my warm up activity was inspired by a suggestion made by a peer in the class. 

Also, I initially had an idea of having students stand in a row and act out selection sort, but had trouble figuring out how to implement that in a zoom class.  Members of my group suggested using Zoom boxes, which turned out to be a suitable substitute.  

Finally, my group also pointed me towards some useful resources when designing my lesson plan, including the Beauty and Joy of Computing Curriculum, which I ended up taking several things from.  While the BJC curriculum doesn't use Python, I was able to adapt a lot of the ideas in their lab on selection sort, including the extension baby names activity and the definition they use for selection sort, for my class.
