I don’t have a simple position on the ideas presented in this podcast.  I hate grading and student’s obsession with grades. It’s even worse nowadays that students have constant access to their grade book (via skedula).  So Feldman’s general critique of convention grading practices really resonated with me.  I’m also shmpathetic to the idea or mastery based grading.  However, as the podcast went on I found myself having more and more reservations about what he was saying.  Below I outline my specific points of disagreement.

Feldman alludes to a major sociological conundrum: the relationship between the individual’s beliefs and actions on the one hand and on the other the effects of the larger structures that  individuals inhabit.  

He observes, correctly, that American culture tends to emphasize the former, downplaying or even ignoring the latter.  He further observes, again correctly, that students’ attitudes toward school are influenced by the structures imposed by the school, including grading policies.     However, Feldman fails to apply this insight cosistently. while he is right that structures we impose as teachers help determine students’ attitudes, he ignores larger structures *beyond the individual teacher*, structures that constrain the actions of teachers at least as much as students.

below are some more specific points:

 1.  Most obvious are the grading policies of a school.  At my own school, we’re expected to allott 10% for participation, 40% for classwork/homework, and 50% for assessments.  Thus a points based grading system is simply baked into the way we do things.

2. A student does not walk into your classeoom a blank slate.  Their attitudes toward grading, and towards schooling in general, are informed by the dozens of other teachers they have had throughout their lives, as well as the culture of the school (not to mention the broader society).  In my experience, it’s not someasy tomchange these attitudes as an individual teacher.

3.  Related to the second point, *points work*, especially when it comes to adjusting students’ behavior. I continue to marvel at how quicky students move into action when ‘points’ are invloved.  Part of this is, as mentioned above, that this is how students have been acculturated within the school system. Partly its that it’s one of the few meaningful consequences a teacher can impose.
