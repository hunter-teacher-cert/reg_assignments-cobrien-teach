# Think different: Three differentiation strategies in the CS classroom

There are a variety of ways to think about differentiation.  Below I consider two variable factors: grouping of students and scaffolding of assignments.  

## Strategy 1: Differentiation by grouping
In general, people differ in how they approach problem solving. Some prefer to work alone, others to work in groups.  Furthermore, in a classroom some students might prefer or even require more direct guidance from the teacher than others.  This strategy address these needs through grouping.

All students are all given the same assignment (i.e. no differentiation by material). However, they are given a choice in terms of who they work with: (i) students may work alone, (ii) they may work together in small groups, or (iii) they may work with the teacher.  

This allows students greater flexibility in problem solving.  Students may also shift between one group and the other. For instance I may wish to work alone at first, and then when I encounter a problem work with other people. You might at first wish to have direct guidance from the teacher and later to work in a small group.  


## 2 scaffolding strategies
In Strategy 1, differentiation by grouping allowed for students to approach the same problem in different ways.  In the two strategies presented below , material is differentiated. While this can be done for a variety of reasons, I here consider a case where students are able to work on the same assignment with varying levels of scaffolding.  

This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, but below I offer two.  The goal is the same for each: All students can accomplish the basic task, with sufficient scaffolding, and thereby be able to appreciate bigger computational questions that the assignment is getting them to explore.  However, students who need it will still be appropriately challenged.

A question arises: How are students grouped? In other words, how to determine which students get which version of the assignment. In general, I lean towards allowing the student to choose which version they work on.  Students typically have an intuition about which version of the assignment is best for them.


### Strategy 2: Differentiation by input

One way to achieve this sort of differentiation is to offer an assignment with different amounts of code already written. For instance, students can be given no pre-written code, and required to make everything themselves.  Another group of students might work on the same problem, but with some helper functions already written and perhaps with the ‘skeleton’ code already available (e.g. method names and parameters).  



### Strategy 3: Differentiation by output

A third strategy is to offer the same basic assignment for all students, but provide extensions that allow students to challenge themselves, stretch their capabilities, or express their creative side.  If strategy 2 is differentiation by input, this can be thought of as differentiation by output, since the resulting product will differ from student to student.  

An advantage here is that differentiation by output allows the student to personalize their work. In addition to the goals outlined above, this also has the advantage of letting students express their creativity, which can increase engagement.

A potential disadvantage: Grading can be more difficult, since we don't expect every assignment to have the same output. However, this can also be useful in discouraging plagiarism, if the expectation is made clear that a student's output should be unique.
