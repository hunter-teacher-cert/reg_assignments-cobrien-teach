# Think different: 3 differentiation strategies in the CS classroom

There are a variety of ways to think about differentiation.  Below I consider two variable factors: grouping of students and scaffolding of assignments.  

## Strategy 1: Grouping
In general, people differ in how they approach problem solving. Some prefer to work alone, others to work in groups.  Furthermore, in a classroom some students might prefer or even require more direct guidance from the teacher than others.  This strategy address these needs through grouping.

All students are all given the same assignment (i.e. no differentiation by material). However, they are given a choice in terms of who they work with: (i) students may work alone, (ii) they may work together in small groups, or (iii) they may work with the teacher.  

This allows students greater flexibility in problem solving.  Students may also shift between one group and the other. For instance I may wish to work alone at first, and then when I encounter a problem work with other people. You might at first wish to have direct guidance from the teacher and later to work in a small group.  




## Strategy 2
In Strategy 1, differentiation by grouping allowed for students to approach the same problem in different ways.  In strategy 2, material is differentiated. While this can be done for a variety of reasons, I here consider a case where students are able to work on the same assignment with varying levels of scaffolding.  This can be accomplished in a variety of ways.  In a CS class, the assignment might be offered with different amounts of code already written. For instance, students can be given no pre-written code, and required to make everything themselves.  Another group of students might work on the same problem, but with some helper functions already written and perhaps with the ‘skeleton’ code already available (e.g. method names and parameters).  


## Strategy 3
