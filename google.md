## The task
This task is part of a project where student's will build their own version of Wordle.  In this portion of the project, the student is asked to write a function called `letter_checker` that asks the user for a guess, and prints out, for each letter in the guess word, whether it also appears in the in the target word. For instance, if the target word is "Python" and the guess is "Potato", the program should output:

    p is not in the target word
    o is in the target word
    t is in the target word
    a is not in the target word
    t is in the target word
    o is in the target word

## Googling
I googled the phrase   `python letter checker guess target word` and found several discussions of problems similar to the assigned task.  For instance:

- in [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68480297/word-guessing-game-in-python), someone is  trying to "create a guessing game that prompts the user for a word, then prompts for letter guesses".  

-  [this Geeks for Geeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-word-guessing-game/) similarly shows code for a word guessing game, where the user guesses complete words.

Both posts include copy/pasteable code.

Both posts posed difficulties for most students who are approaching the task.  In the stack overflow post, the question itself was extremely confusing. In both cases, the problem being posed is slightly different and more complicated than the one I was asking them to solve. Given the relative simplicity of the task, I don't think the posts are terribly helpful. The basically reproduce my task, but with extra bells and whistles that will confuse most students.
