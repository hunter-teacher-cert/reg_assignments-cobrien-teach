Below I create a grading schema for **turtle lab.py**This assignment contains two problems. First the student is asked to define a *nonrecursive* function that makes a turtle object draw a square of whatever size.  Second,  the student is asked to define a *recursive* function that makes a turtle object draw a spiral of whatever size. 

This assignment would be useful for the end of a unit on functions the knowledge needed to successfully complete the project is listed below in order of complexity:

1. use basic Python turtle methods
2. define and call a python function 
3. correctly use function parameters
4. appropriately use Python control 

5. define and call a recursive function  
 
 Full credit (correspinding to an A, 100,etc) obviously entails doing everything listed above.  The trickier question is what constitutes the minimum aceptable grade to pass a class. I think this question depends on what the teacher believes is the most essential knowledge for a given course or assignment. For this exercise, (1) and (2) seem the modt essentially, in that something corresponding to the desired output is impossible without either.  Elements (3) and (4) correspond to higher order understanding.  with that in mind, my proposed grading schema is below:
 
 - D: Define and call two functions that use basic turtle methods draw a square and spiral
- C: do everything for a D but also use function parameters and control structures correctly
- B: do everything for a C, but also show evidence of *attempting* to write a recursive function
- A: do everything for a B, but successfully write a recursive function
